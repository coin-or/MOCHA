This is the calibration test set. 

*.mo files are matroid optimization files that are in the format that
the program matroidtest can read.

The files...
"gn10e22  gn10e28  gn10e33  gn11e13  gn11e20  gn11e27  gn11e41  gn12e16  gn12e24  gn12e33  gn13e19  gn13e29  gn13e39  gn9e18  gn9e27"
are the adjacency matrices for all fifteen graphs.


*INT* files are the randomly selected interior integer points selected for
